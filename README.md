# Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction-System
Creating a price prediction system using LSTM, GRU and a stacked model trained on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple price data

We first train LSTM and GRU models on price data, then try to find the best configurations for our models. Then, using ensemble methods, we stack the best models together. Finally, we created a system using Streamlit to allow users to easily get predictions for future days.
